# AI-Recipe-Generation
This Generative AI Recipe App is designed to help users create recipes based on ingredients they have at hand. It utilizes generative AI to suggest recipes that not only match the input ingredients but also enhance culinary creativity by suggesting novel combinations.

This app utilises GPT-4, DALL-E 3 and Langchain to generate recipes and instructions based on given input items.
